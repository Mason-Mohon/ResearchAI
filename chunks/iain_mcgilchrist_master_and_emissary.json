At first, it was believed that, apart from each hemisphere\nobviously having sensory and motor responsibility for, and control of, the\nopposite (or \u2018contralateral\u2019) side of the body, language was the defining\ndifference, the main specific task of the left hemisphere.

I will look at\nthe evolution of the brain, its divided and asymmetrical nature, the\nimplications of the development of music and language, and what we know\nabout what goes on in each side of the brain. What is it they do that is so\ndifferent? Well, I will argue, nothing much: it is quite true that almost\neverything we once thought went on in one or other hemisphere alone is\nnow known to go on in both.\n5\n So where does that leave the pursuit of\nhemisphere differences? Right on track. The whole problem is that we are\nobsessed, because of what I argue is our affiliation to left-hemisphere\nmodes of thought, with \u2018what\u2019 the brain does \u2013 after all, isn't the brain a\nmachine, and like any machine, the value of it lies in \nwhat it does\n?

Adam Zeman is admirably concise in doing so.\n46\n He distinguishes three principal meanings of the term\nconsciousness: (1) \nconsciousness as waking state\n: \u2018after a lucid interval,\nthe injured soldier lapsed into unconsciousness\u2019; (2) \nconsciousness as\nexperience\n: \u2018I became consciou",

Initially\nthis led to a period of unparalleled richness in Greek culture when the left\nhemisphere and right hemisphere worked in harmony (when, in\nNietzsche's terms, there was a union of Apollo with Dionysus, the time of\nthe birth of tragedy). This was marked not by some sort of compromise, a\nholding back, of both hemispheres in relation to one another, but on the\ncontrary by a going further than had ever been gone before in both\ndirections at once, an unfolding of the potential of each hemisphere such\nas the Western world had never seen before. However, in philosophy, in\nattitudes to the phenomenal world, including ways of, literally, seeing it, in a\nview of the soul and body, in poetry and drama, in architecture and\nsculpture of the human form and face, and in the evolution of the Greek\nalphabet and of currency, we see the balance of power shifting always in\nthe same direction, with the left hemisphere (Apo",

Like Tennyson after him, Wordsworth appears to\nhave been naturally inclined to a sense of the past: his first few poems as a\nyoung man are all about memory. \u2018My soul will cast the backward view\u2019, he wrote; another poem dwells on the \u2018memory of departed pleasures\u2019, and in\na third he wrote: \u2018for only then, when memory is hushed, am I at rest\u2019.\n89\n One\nmight be forgiven for thinking these were the thoughts of age, but they all\ncome from poems he wrote before he was even eighteen years old.\nHowever, as he matures, and certainly by the time of the 1805 Prelude,\nhe begins to see memory as no longer inert and unidirectional, but as\nsomething that \nlives\n, and that at times has the power to revivify us now. In\nThe Prelude\n he famously refers to such moments as \u2018spots of time \u2026\nWhich with distinct pre-eminence retain / A vivifying Virtue\u2019, by which \u2018our\nminds / Are nourished and invisibly repair'd\u2019.\n90\nThe extraordinarily re",

A\nfew of the undoubted difficulties in knowing what it is that one is\nmeasuring here are outlined in a paper by Nadal and colleagues (Nadal,\nMunar, Cap\u00f3 et al., 2008).

She refers to Borges's opinion that \u2018it may be that\nuniversal history is the history of the different intonations given a handful\nof metaphors\u2019 (Borges, 1964, \u2018The fearful sphere of Pascal\u2019, p. 192;\ntrans.

Dept. of English  St. Louis University  As a concept atid term, \u201cworld view\u201d is useful but can at times be misleading. It re-  flects the marked tendency of technologized man to think of actuality as something  essentially picturable and to think of knowledge itself by analogy with visual activity  to the exclusion, more or less, of the other senses. Oral or nonwriting cultures tend  much more to cast up actuality in comprehensive auditory terms, such as voice and har-  mony. Their \u201cworld\u201d is not so markedly something spread out before the eyes as a  \u201cview\u201d but rather something dynamic and relatively unpredictable, an event-world rath-  er than an object-world, highly personal, overtly",

But the Lokele drumming is at least typical,   and Carrington discusses it not only in its essentials but also in rich human   detail. This is all the present study requires, for it undertakes to establish   merely some landmarks.   III  Not all drums that transmit information are talking drums.

A tonal language uses pitch   to distinguish words. Many African languages are tonal. English is not a   tonal language. It is true that English uses tone or pitch to distinguish be-   tween the several possible senses in which a word or a group of words may be   used in a given case. For example, in the following group of words the   speaker raises the pitch of the word good to identify a question: \"It is good?\"   If he wishes the same words to be understood as a declaration, he can lower   the pitch of \"good\": \"It is good.\" Or, to counter a denial, he can raise the   ",

In one of   Carrington's instances (p. 19), the syllables represented in writing or print as   lisaka can have three meanings: if the syllables are pronounced all on the   same pitch (... ) the resulting word means \"pond\"; if the final syllable is   raised in tone (. . ) the resulting word means \"promise\" (the noun); if the   last two syllables are raised in tone (. ? .) the resulting word means \"poison\"  (the noun).

In general, before the invention of script man is more oral-aural than after- ward, not merely in that his words are all spoken and heard words, never visually perceived marks on a surface, but in that his whole response to actuality is thereby organized differently from that of typographic man.

In the course of his study, Walter J.Ong offers fascinating insights into oral genres across the globe and through time and examines the rise of abstract philosophical and scientific thinking.

Anthropologists and sociologists and psychologists have reported on fieldwork in oral societies. Cultural historians have delved more and more into prehistory, that is, human existence before writing made verbalized records possible. Ferdinand de Saussure (1857\u2013 1913), the father of modern linguistics, had called attention to the primacy of oral speech, which underpins all verbal communication, as well as to the persistent tendency, even among scholars, to think of writing as the basic form of language.

Since Saussure, linguistics has developed highly sophisticated studies of phonemics, the way language is nested in sound. Saussure\u2019s contemporary, the Englishman Henry Sweet (1845\u2013 1912), had early insisted that words are made up not of letters but of functional sound units or phonemes.

There is a sizable literature on differences between written and spoken language which compares the written and spoken language of persons who can read and write (Gumperz, Kaltmann and O\u2019Connor 1982 or 1983, bibliography).

The greatest awakening to the contrast between oral modes of thought and expression and written modes took place not in linguistics, descriptive or cultural, but in literary studies, beginning clearly with the work of Milman Parry (1902\u201335) on the text of the Iliad and the Odyssey, brought to completion after Parry\u2019s untimely death by Albert B.Lord, and supplemented by later work of Eric A.Havelock and others.

Before taking up Parry\u2019s discoveries in detail, it will be well to set the stage here by asking why the scholarly world had to reawaken to the oral character of language. It would seem inescapably obvious that language is an oral phenomenon. Human beings communicate in countless ways, making use of all their senses, touch, taste, smell, and especially sight, as well as hearing (Ong 1967b, pp. 1\u20139).

It initiated what print and computers only continue, the reduction of dynamic sound to quiescent space, the separation of the word from the living present, where alone spoken words can exist. 80 ORALITY AND LITERACY By contrast with natural, oral speech, writing is completely artificial.

INTERACTIONS: LEARNED LANGUAGES The second massive development in the West affecting the interaction of writing and orality was Learned Latin. Learned Latin was a direct result of writing.

Written material was subsidiary to hearing in ways which strike us today as bizarre. Writing served largely to recycle knowledge back into the oral world, as in medieval university disputations, in the reading of literary and other texts to groups (Crosby 1936; Ahern 1981; Nelson 1976\u20137), and in reading aloud even when reading to oneself.

First, in a primary oral culture, as Havelock pointed out (1978a; cf. 1963), knowledge cannot be managed in elaborate, more or less scientifically abstract categories. Oral cultures cannot generate such categories, and so they use stories of human action to store, organize, and communicate much of what they know.

Romances are the product of chirographic culture, creations in a new written genre heavily reliant on oral modes of thought and expression, but not consciously imitating earlier oral forms as the \u2018art\u2019 epic did. Popular ballads, as the Border ballads in English and Scots, develop on the edge of orality. The novel is clearly a print genre, deeply interior, de-heroicized, and tending strongly to irony.

Certainly, non-rhetorical styles congenial to women writers helped make the novel what it is: more like a conversation than a platform performance.

ORALITY, WRITING AND BEING HUMAN \u2018Civilized\u2019 peoples have long contrasted themselves with \u2018primitive\u2019 or \u2018savage\u2019 peoples, not only in drawing-room conversation or at cocktail parties but also in sophisticated historical works and anthropological studies. One of the pivotal anthropological works of recent decades, a work cited often in these pages, is Claude L\u00e9vi- Strauss\u2019s The Savage Mind (1966\u2014first French edition, La Pens\u00e9e sauvage, 1962). One thinks also of the earlier works of Lucien L\u00e9vy-Bruhl, Les Fonctions mentales dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s inf\u00e9rieures (1910) and La Mentalit\u00e9 primitive  (1923), and of Franz Boas\u2019s Lowell Lectures, The Mind of Primiti",

The terms \u2018primitive\u2019 and \u2018savage\u2019, not to mention \u2018inferior\u2019, are weighted terms. No one wants to be called primitive or savage, and it is comforting to apply these terms contrastively to other people to show what we are not. The terms are somewhat like the term \u2018illiterate\u2019: they identify an earlier state of affairs negatively, by noting a lack or deficiency. In the current attention to orality and oral-literacy contrasts, a more positive understanding of earlier states of consciousness has replaced, or is replacing, these well-meant, but essentially limiting approaches.

He suggests that the term \u2018primitive\u2019 should be replaced by \u2018without writing\u2019. \u2018Without writing\u2019, however, is still a negative assessment, suggesting a chirographic bias.

Father Patrick Essien,  an African diocesan priest of the diocese of Ikot-Ekpene,  in South-East State in Nigeria, who has just finished a  doctorate in educational administration at Saint Louis  University, comes from a primary oral culture of a small  village of the Annang, a tribe of some half million  persons or more.

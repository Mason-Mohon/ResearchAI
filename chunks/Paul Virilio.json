Rodin retorts, 'Have you ever looked closely at instantaneous  photographs of men in motion? ... Well then, what have you  noticed?'  'That they never seem to be making headway.

They  invented a topographical system, the Method of Loci, an imagery- mnemonics which consisted of selecting a sequence of places,  locations, that could easily be ordered in time and space.

As far back as the sixth century BC, for  instance, the philosopher Parmenides held that mental images, our  memory, resided in a unique relationship between light and heat, cold  and dark, located in the centre of our bodies. If this relationship were  disturbed, amnesia, the forgetting of the visible world, resulted.

But apart from all that, which we know about, the monumental  dimensions of the picture \u2014 thirty-five square metres - tell us some\u00ad thing about Gericault's intentions. He clearly wanted to capture the  attention of the general public, not so much in his capacity as an  artist, but in the manner of a journalist or advertising executive.  Before hitting on the solution of giganticism, he first thought of doing  a painting series, a 'painting in episodes' that would evolve over time  (bit like Poussin's sketches based on the figures of Trajan's Column).

In the end he decided he could overcome pictorial representation's  media handicap by enlarging the spectator's visual field, the size of  the work begging the question, by reversing it, of the space in which  the image could be shown. This crowd painting obviously could not,  through its sheer size, be hung anywhere other than in some vast  public place (a museum?). Unlike an easel painting, which could  adapt to domestic intimacy, unlike the frescoes and monumental  paintings commissioned in the Renaissance, which then spread out  after the fact over the walls of the various palaces and churches,  Gericault's painting was a work looking for a place to hang.

As soon as it was unveiled, in all its internal contradictions, it met  with hostility from painters of all persuasions, critics and art lovers  alike. On the other hand, it was a sensation with the general public  who saw it not so much as a work of art as a pamphlet designed to  discredit the government of Louis XV111. The royal administration,  accused by the opposition of being indirectly responsible for the  tragedy, had in any event made the first move by banning the use of  the name Meduse in the exhibition leaflet.

It follows that that which serves to  see, to understand, to measure and therefore to conceive reality, is not  so much light as its velocity. From now on, speed is less useful in  terms of getting around easily than in terms of seeing and conceiving  more or less clearly.  The time frequency of light has become a determining factor in the  apperception of phenomena, leaving the spatial frequency of matter  for dead.

And with the beginning of the Second World War, General Guderian, practitioner of the Blitzkrieg, concluded: 'where we find the tanks, there is the front'. Thus he fulfils Goebbels designs, who already in 1929 claimed: 'He who can conquer the road, conquers also the State'. All is front from this point on, since everything is mobilized at all times and in all terrains. Where we find the travelling machine, there is the State, the country has disappeared in the non-place of the State of emergency, territorial space vanishes, only Time remains - but only the time that remains.

Around 1860 in Saint-Germain Eugene Flachat produced his project of a pneumatic train where 'the train was interdependent with a piston that moved in an airtight tube. When the machinery created the void in this tube, the piston advanced and propelled the train in motion .^ This system, comparable to pneumatic message tubes, anticipates an electromagnetic system: in 1941, the Germans, experts in ballistics, attempted to produce an electromagnetic rapid-fire gun: 'The engine appeared in the form of a long tube of seventy metres, equipped with numerous electromagnetic coils.

The cinematic motor has accustomed us to finding the mystery of movement in this transitory world natural, to no longer wonder how acceleration of amorous gesture can suddenly become murderous, how the Pavan dance of a falling or propelled body can become fatal. At the same time 109 this vulgarized violence of movement, revealed by the dis- tortion of vision, shows us its inconsistency; the violence of speed dominates the technical world but remains nevertheless, as in the time ofthe Sphinx, the basic enigma.

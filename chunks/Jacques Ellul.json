Foreword In The Technological Society , Jacques Ellul formulates a comprehensive and forceful social philosophy of our technical civilization. Less penetrating than Thorstein Veblen\u2019s The Engineers and the Price System , it nevertheless widens the scope of inquiry into the consequences of having a society pervaded by technicians.

He shows that he is thoroughly familiar with the cant perpetuated by technophobes and for the most part manages to avoid their cliches.

We must not think of the problem in terms of a choice between being determined and being free. We must look at it dialectically, and say that man is indeed determined, but that it is open to him to overcome necessity, and that this act is freedom.

But there, too, man erects a barrier around himself, for he would not know how to defend himself by his own unaided intellect. He uses any means that will serve him both for defense and for adjustment. He turns to his own profit the hostile powers, which are obliged to obey him by virtue of his magical formulas. Mass",

The regicide of Charles I by Cromwell gave the initial and primary impulse to social plasticity; as all writers agree, after this date a rigid social hierarchy no longer existed in England.

A  surgical  operation  which  was  formerly  not  feasible  but  can  now  be performed is not an object of choice. It simply is. Here we see the prime aspect of technical automatism. Technique itself, ipso facto and without indulgence or possible discussion, selects among the means to be employed. The human being is no longer in any sense the agent of choice.

In  the  same  way,  once  a  technical procedure has been discovered, it is applicable in many fields other than the one for which it was primarily invented. The techniques of \u201coperational research,\u201d for example, were devised to help make certain military decisions.

Colonial war opened the door to those European nations that possessed the whole complex of technical means. The conquering nations exported their machines and their organization through their armies.

In the past, when an individual entered into conflict with society, he led a harsh and miserable life that required a vigor which either hardened or broke him. Today the concentration camp and death await him; technique cannot tolerate aberrant activities. Because of the autonomy of technique, modern man cannot choose his means any more than his ends.

In spite of variability and flexibility according to place and circumstance (which are characteristic of technique) there is still only a single employable technique in the given place and time in which an individual is situated. We have already examined the reasons for this. At this point, we must consider the major consequences of the autonomy of technique. This will bring us to the climax of this analysis. Technical autonomy explains the \u201cspecific weight\u201d with which technique is endowed.  It  is  not  a  kind  of  neutral  matter,  with  no  direction,  quality,  or structure.

And if there is a competition between this intrinsic finality and an extrinsic end proposed by man, it is always the intrinsic finality which carries the day. If the technique in question is not exactly adapted to a proposed human end, and if an individual pretends that he is adapting the technique to this end, it is generally quickly evident that it is the end which is being modified, not the technique.

The Best and the Worst The Influence of Technique on the Economy Let us consider first the aspect of the relation between technique and economy which  is  traditionally  studied,  particularly  by  Marx.  Technique,  or  rather techniques, appears as the motive force and the foundation of the economy. Without them, there is no economy. For this reason, a distinction can be made in economics between dynamic force, which is technical invention, and static force, the organization of the economy.

Nor must we overlook the fact that this parentage represents a profound intervention in the economy on the part of the state, an intervention, moreover, not dictated by a theory or a will to power, but by the technical manifest. The necessity of utilizing certain goods also tends in the same direction. It has long been recognized that technical progress is effected more rapidly in the creation of the means of production. From this fact comes a kind of hypertrophy of machine-producing industries.

If the plan corresponds to the real nature of planning, it ought to fix objectives, which normally would not be attained by the play of self-interest and a modicum of effort. It must stretch productive forces to the maximum, arouse energies, and exploit existing means with the maximum of efficiency.

A  bond  is  thus  established  between  the  state  and  the  economy  whereby technical progress is not possible without the intervention of the state.

Vincent\u2019s  thesis  can  be summarized as follows: \u201cHow will the advantages of technical progress be divided  in  a  pure  liberal  regime,  supposing  perfect  competition  and nonintervention  of  the  state?

The  Italian economist Bertolino gives a good example of this argument in his study of standardization. Standardization produces certain democratic effects, according to  this  economist,  for  two  reasons.  First,  it  reduces  prices;  consequently consumption  is  increased,  welfare  is  more  widely  distributed,  and  living standards are equalized Second, it reduces the types of available merchandise; there is less diversity on the mar",

For the liberals, economic man was an abstraction created to satisfy the demands of economic inquiry. The conception was a working hypothesis. It was framed by omitting certain  human  characteristics,  which  man  undeniably  possesses  in  order  to reduce him to his economic aspect of producer and consumer. The abstraction corresponded  to  a  complete  anthropology,  current  at  the  beginning  of  the nineteenth century, which can only be characterized as dichotomous.

It is necessary to evaluate the cost of every administrative operation and to apply the law of marginal yield. Funds are assigned to each department on the basis of a standard cost established through service. By introducing modern double-entry bookkeeping, it is possible to carry out a constant inspection of activities on every level and to establish the relation between actual and standard expenses. In this way, the law of the technician  transforms  the  administrative  perspective.  Every  administration becomes an object, as formerly the worker became an object in Taylor\u2019s hands.

It is a remarkable fact that all societies which have arrived at a certain degree of state control and legal evolution have found the same answer to this question. In Egypt, in Rome in the fourth century after Christ, in fifteenth-century France, and in all of twentieth-century Western civilization, the concept of order and security is substituted for justice as the end and foundation of law when judicial technique becomes sufficiently developed.

The means of exerting action on men must answer to the following three criteria: (1) Generality. Every man must be reached in every area of life because everyone is involved. Individual action is unimportant, (a) Objectivity. Action, since it is a function of society itself, cannot be dependent upon the transient and subjective acts of individuals. The means",

Since  the  technical  challenge  to  man  concerns  his  whole  life, psychic action must be exerted upon him without letup, from the beginning of his existence to its end.

Clearly, when modern youth are fully educated in the new psychopedagogic technique, many social and political difficulties will disappear. Any form of government or social transformation becomes possible with individuals who have experienced this never-ending process of adaptation.

Its goal  is  to  make  the  masses  \u201cavailable,\u201d  by  working  spells  upon  them  and exercising a kind of fascination. The second category involves the creation of a sort of temporary impulsiveness in its objects. It operates by simple pressure and is  often  contradictory  (since  contradictory  mass  mov",

Of  course,  this  dissociation  can  be  effective  only  after  the propaganda technique has been completely fused with the popular mores and has become indispensable to the population. This stage may be reached quickly, as, for example, in Germany in 1942, after only ten years of psychic manipulation. The same result seems to have been obtained in the Soviet Union, where the masses have been conditioned to the fluctuations of the party line.

If they cannot stand or understand one another, if they have nothing to say, radio and television make this easy to bear by 1 re-establishing external relations and avoiding friction.

As for medical technique, what is to be feared and hoped from its application? And with what other technical system will this technique be interrelated? The answer is: solely with the state. And this indicates what we have to fear. It is universally understood that technical means begin to be dangerous when the state begins to exploit them, utilizing them in connection with its arbitrary, omnipotent decisions.

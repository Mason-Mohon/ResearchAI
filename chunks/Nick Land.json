The ascent through various levels of illusion to the naked light of  the sun is the most powerful myth of the ph ilosophical project, but it is also the account  of a political struggle, in which Socrates an ticipates his death.

Glaucon immediately concurs with this suggestion.  Such violence is not unilateral. The philosopher, after all, has an interest in the sun that is  not purely a matter of knowledge. To have witnessed the sun is a gain and an entitlement;  a supra-terrestrial invitation (however reluctantly accepted) to rule:   So our cities will be governed by us  and you with waking minds, and not,  as most cities now which are inhabited and ruled darkly as in a dream by  men who fight one another for shadows and wrangle for of",

Its conversion into a statistically constrained gene pool then stabilizes the species from further evolutionary change. Established species are far more notable for their stasis than change.

The third seminal realization is that evolution extends past the change in organisms as products of evolution to change in the process itself.

Evolutionists know this fact but have never accorded the fact the importance that it deserves because it is incommensurate with Darwinism.

Since principles cannot change with time or circumstances, evolution must be fundamentally static.   Of course, biological evolution is not like this at all. It is an actual complex process, not a principle. The way that it takes place can, and indisputably does, change with time. This is of utmost importance because the process of evolution advances as it proceeds (Campbell, 1986).

Its point of departure  is the Moldbuggian principle that \u2018sovereignty is conserved\u2019 and everything that  follows from it, both theoretically and practically. The virtual conclusion of this  controversy is the central assertion of Dark Enlightenment, which we do not yet  comprehend.  The problem is this: Can real \u2014 which is to say ultimate (or sovereign) \u2014 political  authority be constrained? Moldbug\u2019s answer is \u2018no\u2019 . A constrained authority is a  superseded authority, or delegated power. To limit government is to exceed, and  thus supplant it. It follows that \u2018constitutionalism\u2019 is a ma",

Without an implicit economy of power, no discrimination could be  made between improvement and deterioration, and no directed action toward  the former could be possible.  The effective cyclic reproduction of power has an external criterion \u2014 survival. It  is not open to any society or regime to decide for itself what works. Its inherent  understanding of its own economics of power is a complex measurement, gaug- ing a relation to the outside, whose consequences are life and death. Built into  the idea of sovereign property from the start, therefore, is an accommodation to  reality.

Already with the wave of Deleu zian  texts of the late 1960s - and more particular ly with the  a ppearance of Difference and Repetition - a consistent philo\u00ad sophical project is discernible, most precisely described  as tran scende ntal Spinozism, or a cri tique of identi ty.  Parallel in a certain sense to Schelling, but without any  obvious direct influence, Deleuze is deli ghted by the  natur alistic basis of Spinoza' s thinking, but understands  it as lacking an explicit transc endental comprehension  of identi ty. Del euze' s response is typically generous;  smuggling in the required mac hine-part and pr etend ing  it was already there.

Templexity, unlike \u2018time-travel\u2019, is not limited to its narrativization, but is that which time-travel narrative \u2013 or drama \u2013 is ultimately about. To salvage this proposition from casual dogmatism, it is necessary to admit, hypothetically, that time-travel might be \u2018about\u2019 nothing. This is even probable, if thoughtfully understood. Templexity is therefore an emergent question, at least initially, and for \u2018us\u2019.

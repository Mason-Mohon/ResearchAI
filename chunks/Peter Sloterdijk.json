In the name ofthrowing off oppressivetradition, the protracted revolt of the 6os generation as it marched through society's institutions acted as a battering ram for the unrestrained freedom of market-mediated self-interest.

These intuitions are prefigured in the schemata of Christian eschatology.

Why this emphasis?  We have to speak of space because humans are them\u00ad selves an effect of the space they create. Human evo\u00ad lution can only be understood if we also bear in mind  the mystery of insulation/island-making [Insulierungs\u00ad geheimsis] that so defines the emergence of humans:  Humans are pets that have domesticated themselves  in the incubators of early cultures.

The camps of man's ancestors, dating back over  a million years, already indicated that they were  distancing themselves from their surroundings.  In the third volume of your trilogy there is an  extensive chapter on architecture, \"Indoors:  Architectures of Foam.\" Why did you choose  such a provocative metaphor?  First of all for a philosophical reason: We are simply  not capable of continuing the old cosmology of ancient  Europe that rested on equating the house and home with  the world. Classical metaphysics is a phantasm on an  implicit motif that was highlighted in only a few places\u00ad by Hegel and Heidegger for example - namely that ",

So the quest\u00ad ions are: Why should modern thought bid goodbye to  this equation of world and house? Why do we need a  new image in order to designate how modern man lives  in social and architectural containers? Why do I propose  the concept of foams?

Through the motif of the inhabited  cell I can uphold the spherical imperative that applies to  all forms of human life but does not presuppose cosmic ,  totalization. The stacking of cells in an apartment  block, for instance, no longer generates the classical  world/house entity but an architectural foam, a multi\u00ad chambered system made up of relatively stabilized  personal worlds.

The structure of foam is incompatible with  a monospherical mindset; the whole can no longer  be portrayed as a large, round whole. Let me use an  anecdote to indicate the immense change: In his  memoirs, Albert Speer recollects that the designs for the  giganto-manic new Reich Chancellery in Berlin originally  envisaged a swastika crowning the dome, which was  to be over 290 meters high.

By contrast, around 1920, in his reflections on  the fundamentals of theoretical biology [Theoretische  Biologie], Jakob von Uexkiill had already affirmed:  \"It was an error to believe that the human world consti\u00ad tuted a shared stage for all living creatures.

He therefore asks the question:  How does capitalist man in the 19th century express  his need for an interior? The answer is: He uses the most  cutting-edge technology in order to orchestrate the  most archaic of all needs, the need to immunize exist\u00ad ence by constructing protective islands. In the case of  the arcade, modern man opts for glass, wrought iron,  and assembly of prefabricated parts in order to build  the largest possible interior. For this reason, Joseph ",

It is the prototype of  all later theme-park interiors and event architectures.  The arcade heralds the abolition of the outside world.  It abolishes outdoor markets and brings them indoors,  into a closed sphere. The antagonistic spatial types of  salon and market meld here to form a hybrid.

Wilhelm Grimm  The following letter was sent to the sevent y-eight-year -old Goet he by the  seventy-five -year -old Zelter, after the latter arrived in Weimar and before he  crossed Goethe's threshold. It has often been remarked that, in our litera\u00ad ture , glory and fame attach most readily to youth, to beginners, and still  more to those who achieve perfection ear ly. How infre quently the mature  200 . 1936  man makes his appe arance there is underscored by each new engagement  with Lessing.

He contrasted it with traditional art. \"P ainting has long been lea ding a  comfor table life; it flatters the cultured connoisseur who pays for it. It is a  luxury article ....

Benj amin' s  review was originally written as part of a letter of June 12, 19 38, to Gershom  Scholem, translated in this volume. Franz Kafka (18 83 -1 924 ), born in Prague of  Jewish par entage, was one of the most original writers of the twentieth century.  He studied law at the University of Prague and later worked for an insuran ce  company.

His novels were  published posthumously as Der Prozess (The Trial; 19 25), Das Schloss (The Cas\u00ad tle, 19 26), and Amerika (19 27). Max Brod (188 4-1 96 8), likewise born in Prague  of Jewish parents, was the author of fiction, lyric poe try, a play, and works on  pacifism and Zionism. He came to know Kafka as a student in 19 02-1903, and  remained a devoted friend to the end of Kafka' s life, afterward editing his major  works.  2. \"D as Schaf fen\": Benj amin dist ingu ishes scha ffen and sch opfen.

In the biogra\u00ad phy of Kafka, Brod repeats his point that the indications of his friend' s renewed  interest in life, after he had met Dora Dymant in the summer of 19 23, gave him  the courage to regard Kafka's written instructi ons, concerning his posthumous  papers, as no longer valid (198).  4.

On a sec\u00ad ond reading, when the thought of Stalin crossed my mind, I didn't dare take  it seriously . Such a reaction corresponded more or less to what Brecht in\u00ad tend ed. He explained this to me in a sub sequent conversation in which he  particularly stressed, among other things, the posi tive aspe cts of the poem.  It was indeed a tribute to Stal in-wh o, in his opinion, had made immense  cont ributions. But Stalin wasn't dead yet.

I began loo king for these in the strange, the  horri ble, the bewit ched; and this time, too, it was before a ca binet that I in\u00ad tended to tast e them. But the game was riski er. Innocence had had its day,  and this game originated in a prohibition. I was forbidden, that is, to read  certain works that I hoped would provide ample compensation for the lost  world of the fairy tales .

This so-called Hornberg letter-which Benjamin called \"g reat and memora\u00ad ble \" (A dorno Letter s, 116 )-touches on a host of topics, but singles out three areas  as especiall y pro blematic : commodit y, myth, and dream. Adorno criticizes Ben\u00ad ja min's concept of the commod ity for being too abstract and for failing to bring out  \"the commo dity char acter specific for the nineteenth century-that is, ... the indus\u00ad trial form of the commodit y, as clear ly distinct from the older form \" (108).

Yet even the visit of the Wiss ings in  Paris, on their way to a new life in Brazil, occasioned thoughts in Benjamin that  were marked equall y by melancholy and by his acerbic wit. In a letter to his son,  Stefan, Benjamin noted that the Wissings' emigration to Brazil required their con\u00ad version to Catholici sm. \"The saying 'It's enou gh to make you Catholic' comes from  the Middle Ages; and, happi ly, we seem to be right back there again \" (G B, VI, 88).

This does not diminish its importance, however; if anything, it underlines it. The dispute was in fact the symptom of a historical transformation the universal impact of which was not realized by either of the rivals. When the age of mechanical reproduction separated art from its basis in cult, the semblance of its autonomy disappeared forever. The resulting change in the function of art transcended the perspective of the century; for a long time it even escaped that of the twentieth century, which experienced the development of the \ufb01lm.

A painting has always had an excellent chance to be viewed by one person or by a few. The simultaneous contemplation of paintings by a large public, such as developed in the nineteenth century, is an early symptom of the crisis of painting, a crisis which was by no means occasioned exclusively by photography but rather in a relatively independent manner by the appeal of art works to the masses.

Fascism attempts to organize the newly created proletarian masses without affecting the property structure which the masses strive to eliminate. Fascism sees its salvation in giving these masses not their right, but instead a chance to express themselves.31 The masses have a right to change property relations; Fascism seeks to give them an expression while preserving prop- erty.

To develop such differentiations was an important function of the trade in works of art. The invention of the woodcut may be said to have struck at the root of the quality of authenticity even before its late \ufb02owering. To be sure, at the time of its origin a medieval picture of the Madonna could not yet be said to be \u201cauthentic.\u201d It became \u201cauthentic\u201d only during the succeeding centuries and perhaps most strikingly so during the last one. 4",

Piety at an early time required them for worship, but it could do without beautiful images. These might even be disturbing.

Since Hubert Grimme\u2019s research it has been known that the Madonna originally was painted for the purpose of exhibition. Grimme\u2019s research was inspired by the question: What is the purpose of the molding in the foreground of the painting which the two cupids lean upon?

Before the advent of the \ufb01lm there were photo booklets with pictures which \ufb02itted by the onlooker upon pressure of the thumb, thus portraying a boxing bout or a tennis match. Then there were the slot machines in bazaars; their picture sequences were produced by the turning of a crank. Secondly, the traditional art forms in certain phases of their development strenuously work toward effects which later are effortlessly attained by the new ones. Before the rise of the movie the Dadaists\u2019 performances tried to create an audience reaction which Chaplin later evoked in a more natural way.

Before the movie had begun to create its public, pictures that were no longer immobile captivated an assembled audience in the so-called Kaiserpanor- ama. Here the public assembled before a screen into which stereoscopes were mounted, one to each beholder. By a mechanical process individual pictures appeared brie\ufb02y before the stereoscopes, then made way for others. Edison still had to use similar devices in presenting the \ufb01rst movie strip before the \ufb01lm screen and projection were known. This strip was presented to a small public which stared into the apparatus in which the succession of pictures was reeling off. Incidentally, the insti",

Shortly before the movie turned the reception of pictures into a collective one, the individual viewing of pictures in these swiftly outmoded establishments came into play once more with an intensity comparable to that of the ancient priest beholding the statue of a divinity in the cella. 40 Walter Benjamin 26 The theological archetype of this contemplation is the awareness of being alone with one\u2019s God. Such awareness, in the heyday of the bourgeoisie, went to strengthen the freedom to shake off clerical tutelage. During the decline of the bourgeoisie this aware-",

Both appear as de\ufb01cient attempts of art to accommodate the pervasion of reality by the apparatus. In contrast to the \ufb01lm, these schools did not try to use the apparatus as such for the artistic presentation of reality, but aimed at some sort of alloy in the joint presentation of reality and apparatus. In Cubism, the premonition that this apparatus will be structurally based on optics plays a dominant part; in Futurism, it is the premonition of the effects of this apparatus which are brought out by the rapid sequence of the \ufb01lm strip. 30 Duhamel,",

Mass reproduction is aided especially by the reproduction of masses. In big parades and monster rallies, in sports events, and in war, all of which nowadays are captured by camera and sound recording, the masses are brought face to face with themselves. This process, whose signi\ufb01cance need not be stressed, is intimately connected with the development of the techniques of reproduction and photography.

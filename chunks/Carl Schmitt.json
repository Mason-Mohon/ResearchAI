    "text": "ints to Eric Voegelin\u2019s Order and  History (1974). For a more popular representation  of the theme one could hardly do better than  recall William F. Buckley Jr.\u2019s (1955) mission  statement for National Review : \u201cIt stands  athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no  one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience  with those who so urge it.\u201d 16. For his redescription of \u201cbeing-  in- the- world\u201d  as \u201cbeing- in- spheres,\u201d see Sloterdijk (1998)  2011: 333 \u2013 35, 339, and (2001b) 2017. For an  extended critical comparison of Heidegger\u2019s and  Sloterdijk\u2019s views on spatial ontology, see Morin  2012. See also Latour 2009: 140. 17. As Zeitlin (2015: 11n9) points out, Schmitt\u2019s  reference is to the last six words of Friedrich  H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s 1",

    "text": "n (2015: 11n9) points out, Schmitt\u2019s  reference is to the last six words of Friedrich  H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s 1800 poem \u201cLebenslauf\u201d (\u201cCurriculum  vitae\u201d). 18. Sloterdijk\u2019s own political views are somewhat  complicated, and he is often criticized for his  perceived complicity in \u201clite\u201d reactionary politics.  See, e.g., Honneth (2009) 2010; M\u00fcller 2016;  and Sutherland 2019. Although the question of  Sloterdijk\u2019s political commitments is beyond the  scope of this article, I maintain that, in contrast to  Schmitt, Sloterdijk\u2019s positive theorization of space  is at odds with and can therefore be divorced from  any reactionary positions, real or imagined.

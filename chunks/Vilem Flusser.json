His critique  is somewhat puzzling given his Foucauldian, historical approach to  media, in which \u201cdiscourse networks\u201d are defined by epochs and  are accordingly decidedly different from one another.5 One area of Flusser\u2019s media theory that deserves special atten- tion is the connection he drew between writing and history and  the implications of this analysis for a concept of temporality.

The knots of this net are human  and artificial intelligences, where the information accumulates  to be stored, computed into new information, and finally sent on  toward other knots.

To Govern 123 In the universe of technical, telematic images, there is no place for  authors or authorities. Both have become superfluous through the  automation of production, reproduction, distribution, and judg- ment. In this universe, images will govern the experience, behavior,  desire, and perceptions of individuals and society, which raises the  question, what does govern mean when no decisions need to be  made and where administration is automatic? In a telematic society,  does it still make sense to speak of government, of power and the  powerful? I will attempt t",

I will attempt to answer by way of etymology, that is,  by way of the roots of those languages in which a millennium of  our experience is stored. One immediately confronts the curious pairing of words gov- ernment\u2013Regierung. The word government is from the Greek verb  kybernein, meaning \u201cto steer, \u201d and can be recognized in cybernet- ics. The German word Regierung is from the Latin-Etruscan noun  rex, meaning \u201cking, \u201d and its root is the ancient rg, meaning \u201cright. \u201d  At this first glance, then, government is concerned with steering,  taxation, and tax collection and Regierung with jurisprudence  and institutions.

But in fact, government means  \u201csteering\u201d and Regierung means \u201cjudgment, \u201d so expressions such  as \u201cjust government\u201d or \u201cleft Regierung\u201d are like squared circles.  124   \u2734   INTO THE UNIVERSE OF TECHNICAL IMAGES Chance can be considered from two perspectives.

The problems are as   follows. 1. To Abstract: What are technical images?

By means of apparatuses equipped with keys, which  begs the question of whether and how these keys control the  apparatus and how the keys are and should be set up. 5. To Envision: If technical images are actually mosaics and not  really surfaces, how can we regard them as pictures?

They are models that give  form to a world and a consciousness that has disintegrated;  they are meant to \u201cinform\u201d that world. Their vector of signi- fication is therefore the reverse of that of earlier images: they  don\u2019t receive their meaning from outside but rather project  meaning outward.

And the fault lines,  where the ice yields to the force of the rising ship, where particular  signs split and proliferate to carry Flusser\u2019s thought, vary from  language to language.

The University of Minnesota Press is the \ufb01rst Ameri- can publisher to honor this inspiring thinker with a comprehensive anthology.

Meanwhile, he introduces his own subtle reinterpretation: Naturally, Buber\u2019s book A Dialogical Life should be considered a theo- logical work; it does not speak \u201cof\u201d God, but rather \u201cto\u201d God, and it does this in that it speaks to us.

One thing is obvious: \ufb01ction pretends, very often, to represent facts by substituting for them or pointing at them. (This is the case of the stone, its photograph, and its explanation.) How can \ufb01ction do this? Through symbols. Symbols are things that have by convention been appointed as representatives of other things (be that convention implicit and uncon- scious, or explicit and conscious). The things that symbols represent are their meaning. We must therefore ask how the various symbols of the world of \ufb01ctio",

(1983\u201384) The Future of Writing 69 70 Images in the New Media Among other things, an image is a message. It has a sender and it searches for an addressee. This search is a question of its portability. Images are surfaces. How does one transport surfaces? It all depends on the physical bodies on whose surfaces the images are af\ufb01xed. If these bodies are the walls in a cave (as in Lascaux), they are not portable. In cases such as these, the addressees must be transported to the pictures. There are more convenient and more portable physical bodies to which images can be af- \ufb01xed, such as wooden boards and framed canvases. In",

There was one common thread: the Portuguese language. On the one hand, Luso- Brazilian is archaic in comparison to the language spoken in Portugal (Renaissance elements can be identi\ufb01ed); on the other hand, it is wild (African elements had made their way in). Still, this is what enabled Por- tuguese to become a lingua franca for speakers of Arabic and Japanese.

From our perspective, from the perspective of Kafka\u2019s partner in dialogue, his mes- sage is premature. My reasons for this assertion are the following: Kafka lived in a world whose problematic had little or nothing to do with that of his contemporaries, which is why he was not \u201cunderstood\u201d during his lifetime. The problems that persecuted and plagued him meant nothing to those who lived with him. Only today do some of these problems begin to take on signi\ufb01cance\u2014for example, the situation of parents who \ufb02ee from an impersonal persecution executed by insigni\ufb01- cant functionaries.

Another example is the situation of a man who has lost his individuality and has become a cog in the ap- paratus. However, Kafka\u2019s work contains several situations where we can- not imagine ourselves as participants or where we simply cannot relate authentically, even though we can understand them on an intellectual level.

In turn, the industrial revolu- tion built this type of work powered by leisure into the economic engine. The current revolution in automation reveals this building of leisure into work and the subsequent engineering of work into economy in a pe- culiar way. In fact, it appears that the degraded and disenchanted leisure bloats up in the abdomen of work, and, following the economy\u2019s diges- tion of work, the entire economic engine swells up like a soap bubble. Thus, the current problem of idleness, of joblessness, and of free time ap- pears as an economic problem: it calls the economic engine and industri- ousness into question.

But, one has to view it from this perspective: Behind every animal, one sees a will; \u201cIt\u201d wants behind all animals and through all animals, and one calls this de- siring \u201cIt\u201d life. On the human being\u2019s side, this \u201cIt\u201d wants to be human, and inside a man it wants to be something else (a superman). However, this trick to simplify the somersault of perspective cannot be recommended. In doing so, one does not necessarily arrive at a Christian or Marxist view of humanization, where it does not matter that \u201cIt\u201d wants to be human, but that \u201csomeone\u201d (God or man himself) w",

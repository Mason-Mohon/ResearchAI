Even Kant got carried away by the possibilities that statistical calculation afforded; he incorporated the lawful order it allowed him to discern into his teleological view of history. On the one hand, he posited the existence of free will. On the other, he restricted it. Kant affirmed that phenomena of free will \u2013 that is, human actions \u2013 are determined by general laws of nature, like every other natural fact. If one considers th",

Neoliberal psychopolitics is a technology of domination that stabilizes and perpetuates the prevailing system by means of psychological programming and steering.

As such, the idiot is similar in nature to the child, who is not yet an individual,  not  yet  a  person.  The  child\u2019s  existence  is  not  determined  by individual qualities so much as impersonal events : For example, very small children all resemble one another and have hardly any individuality, but they have singularities: a smile, a gesture, a funny face \u2013 not subjective qualities. Small children, through all their sufferings and weaknesses, are infused with an immanent life that is pure power and even bliss. 11 The idiot is like Deleuze\u2019s \u2018homo tantum\u2019 \u2013 one who \u2018no longer has a",

Psychopower, on the other  hand, can intervene in psychological processes themselves. Chris Anderson, editor in chief of Wired magazine,  recently published a telling article, \u201cThe End of Theory.\u201d He  claims that inconceivably vast quantities of data have made  theoretical models superfluous: \u201cToday companies like  Google, which have grown up in an era of massively abun - dant data, don\u2019t have to settle for wrong models.

Avoiding nostalgia, I sketch a genealog y of their  disappearance, a disappearance which, however, I do not  interpret as an emancipatory process. Along the way, the  pathologies of the present da y will become visible, most  of all the erosion of community. At the same time, I offer  reflections on different forms of life that might be able to  free our society from its collective narcissism. 1 1 The Compulsion of Production Rituals are s ymbolic acts.

All  members perform themselves. All produce themselves.  Everyone pays homage to the cult of the self, the worship  of self in which everyone is his or her own priest.

This is the  background understanding to the modern ideal of authen- ticity, and to the goals of self-fulfilment or self-realization  in which it is usually couched. This is the background that  gives moral force to the culture of authenticity, including  its most degraded, absurd, or trivialized forms.1 17 The creation of self, however, must not be self-centred; it  has to take place against the backdrop of a social horizon  of meaning that gives the act of self-creation a relevance  that transcends the self: Only if ",

Authenticity is not  the enemy of demands that emanate from be yond the  self; it supposes such demands.2 From this perspective, authenticit y and communit y are  not mutually exclusive.

War is nothing but a duel on a larger  scale.\u20196 War is an orderly, rule-guided duel.

The play with power is character- ized by reciprocity. Thus, Foucault interprets power from  the perspective of the economy of pleasure: Power is not evil. Power is games of strateg y.

An interesting, reciprocal relationship holds between social and  biological discourses. The sciences are not free of nonscientific dis- positives. Accordingly, a paradigm shift occurred within medical  immunology at the end of the Cold War. In America, Polly Matz- inger discarded the immunological model of preceding decades.  According to her model, the immune system does not distinguish  between \u201cself\u201d and \u201cnon-self,\u201d i.e., domestic and foreign, but between  \u201cfriendly\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d See Polly Matzinger, \u201cFriendly and Dan- gerous Signals: Is the Tissue in Control?\u201d Nature Immunology 8.1  (2007): 11\u201313",

The object of immune defense is no longer foreignness  or Otherness as such. Only foreign intruders that act destructively in  inner, domestic space are combated. So long as what is foreign does  not attract unwelcome attention, immune defenses ignore it. It fol- lows that the biological immune system is more hospitable than pre- viously assumed. That is, it does not harbor xenophobia. As such, it  proves more intelligent than human societies.

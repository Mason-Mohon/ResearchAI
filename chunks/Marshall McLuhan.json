Be assured: this is not just a rehashing of old  fare dished up between new covers, but is genuinely new  food  for thought  and meditation.  This study began  when  the publisher asked my father to consider  revising Understanding Media for a second edition.  When  he decided to  start on a book, my father began by setting up some file folders - a dozen or  two - and popping notes into them as fast as observations or discoveries,  large or small, occurred to him. Often the notes would be on backs of  envelopes or on scraps of paper and in his own special shorthand,  sometimes  a written or dictated paragraph or two, sometimes an  advertisement or press clipping, sometimes just a passage, photo",

Myth is contraction or implosion of any process, and the instant speed of electricity confers the mythic dimension on ordinary industrial and social action today.

The person who falls suddenly experiences immunity to all pain or sensory stimuli because the central nervous system has to be protected from any intense thrust of sensation. Only gradually does he regain normal sensitivity to sights and sounds, at which time he may begin to tremble and perspire and to react as he would have done if the central nervous system had been prepared in advance for the fall that occurred unexpectedly.

In our age artists are able to mix their media diet as easily as their book diet. A poet like Yeats made the fullest use of oral peasant culture in creating his literary effects. Quite early, Eliot made a great impact by the careful use of jazz and film form. The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock gets much of its power from an interpenetration of film form and jazz idiom. But this mix reached its greatest power in The Waste Land and Sweeney Agonistes. Prufrock uses not only film form but the film theme of Charlie Chaplin, as did James Joyce in Ulysses.

In Western literate society it is still plausible and acceptable to say that something \u201cfollows\u201d from something, as if there were some cause at work that makes such a sequence. It was David Hume who, in the eighteenth century, demonstrated that there is no causality indicated in any sequence, natural or logical",

Until 1700 much more than 50 per cent of all printed books were ancient or medieval. Not only antiquity but also the Middle Ages were given to the first reading public of the printed word. And the medieval texts were by far the most popular. Like any other extension of man, typography had psychic and social consequences that suddenly shifted previous boundaries and patterns of culture.

Their journalism exudes the private point of view of the literary mandarin.

As extensions of the popular response to the workaday stress, games become faithful models of a culture. They incorporate both the action and the reaction of whole populations in a single dynamic image. A Reuters dispatch for December 13, 1962, reported from Tokyo: BUSINESS IS A",

From the first days of Christianity there grew a habit, in some quarters, of spiritual clowning, of \u201cplaying the fool in Christ,\u201d",

Play goes with an awareness of huge disproportion between the ostensible situation and the real stakes. A similar sense hovers over the game situation, as such. Since the game, like any art form, is a mere tangible model of another situation that is less accessible, there is always a tingling sense of oddity and fun in play or games that renders the very earnest and very serious person or society laughable.

In no time at all, the telephone expanded the work to be done on the typewriter to huge dimensions. Pyramids of paperwork rise on the basis of a small telephone network inside a single business.

In the same way, mobile panzer divisions equipped with radio telephones upset the traditional army structure. And we have seen how the news reporter linking the printed page to the telephone and the telegraph created a unified corporate image out of the fragmented government departments.

The same kind of fragmentation and specialism in the arts and sciences made possible mammoth results in industry and in military enterprise, and in massive cooperative enterprises such as the newspaper and symphony orchestra.

Is not this because \u201cweather\u201d is now entirely an electronic form of information, whereas news retains much of the pattern of the printed word? It is probably the print and book bias of the BBC and the CBC that renders them so awkward and inhibited in radio and TV presentation. Commercial urgency, rather than artistic insight, fostered by contrast a hectic vivacity in the corresponding American operation.

They pore, they probe, they slow down and involve themselves in depth. This is what they had learned to do in the cool iconography of the comic-book medium. TV carried the process much further.

At this hour, when Americans are discovering new passions for skin- diving and the wraparound space of small cars, thanks to the indomitable tactile promptings of the TV image, the same image is inspiring many English people with race feelings of tribal exclusiveness. Whereas highly literate Westerners have always idealized the condition of integration of races, it has been their literate culture that made impossible real uniformity among races.

How could it possibly pervade our lives any more than it does? Mere classroom use could not extend its influence. Of course, in the classroom its role compels a reshuffling of subjects, and approaches to subjects. Merely to put the present classroom on TV would be like putting movies on TV.

Spraying the air with lead in a kind of tactual embrace was found to be good by night, as well as by day, and sighting was unnecessary. At this stage of technology, the literate man is somewhat in the position of the old-timers who backed the Springfield rif",

By his method of interplay among  divergent perceptual modes, de Tocqueville was able to react to his world,  not in sections but as a whole, and as to an open field. And such is the method  which A.

The division of faculties which results from the technological dilation or  externalization of one or another sense is so pervasive a feature of the past  century that today we have become conscious, for the first time in history, of  how these mutations of culture are initiated. Those who experience the first  onset of a new technology, whether it be alphabet or radio, respond most  emphatically because the new sense ratios set up at once by the technological  dilation of eye or ear, present men with a surprising new world, which evokes  a vigorous new \"closure,\" or novel pattern of interplay, among all of the  senses together.

A modern physicist with his habit of \"field\" percep- tion, and his sophisticated separation from our conventional habits of New- tonian space, easily finds in the pre-literate world a congenial kind of wisdom.  Heisenberg is discussing \"science as a part of the interplay between man  and Nature\" (p. 20) :  In this connection it has often been said that the far-reaching changes in  our environment and in our way of life wrought by this technical age have  also changed dangerously our ways of thinking, and that here lie the roots  of the crises which have shaken our times and which, for instance, are also  expressed in mode",

True, this objection is much older than modern  technology and science, the use of implements going back to man's earliest  beginnings. Thus, two and a half thousand years ago, the Chinese sage  Chuang-Tzu spoke of the danger of the machine when he said:  `As Tzu-Gung was travelling through the regions north of the river Han,  he saw an old man working in his vegetable garden. He had dug an irrigation  ditch. The man would descend into the well, fetch up a vessel of water in his  arms and pour it out into the ditch.

In this way you can bring up water so quickly that it just  gushes out. This is called a draw-well.\"  `Then anger rose up in the old man's face, and he said, \"I have heard my  teacher say that whoever uses machines does all his work like a machine.

The modern phases of this process are the  theme of Mechanization Takes Command by Siegfried Giedion.  However, Giedion is concerned with a minute tracing of the stages by  which in the past century we have used mechanism to recover organic form:  In his celebrated studies of the 'seventies on the motions of men and  animals, Edward Muybridge set up a series of thirty cameras at twelve-inch  intervals, releasing their shutters electromagnetically as soon as the moving  object passed before the plate. . . .

By revolving a sequence of such static or  pictorial spaces at a sufficient speed, the illusion of organic wholeness, or  interplay of spaces, is created. Thus, the wheel finally becomes the means of  moving our culture away from the machine. But it was by means of electricity  applied to the wheel that the wheel merges once more with animal form.

But the music of non-literate people has no such repetitive cyclic and  abstract form as melody. Invention, in a word, is translation of one kind of  space into another.

But most  frequently, when legere and lectio are used without further explanation, they  mean an activity which, like chant and writing, requires the participation of  the whole body and the whole mind.

Smalley, indeed, records (p. 53 ) that the  marginal gloss, although of unknown origin, served among its users \"as notes  for the delivery of oral lecturae.\"  In an unpublished master's thesis32  John H.

In an article on \"Liturgy and Spiritual Personalism\" in  Worship (October, 1960, p. 494) Thomas Merton points out:  Liturgy is, in the original and classical sense of the word, a political activity.  Leitourgeia was \"a public work\", a contribution made by a free citizen of the  polis. As such, it was distinct from the economic activity or the private and  more material concern of making a living and managing the productive  enterprises of the \"household\" . . . ",

Of the penetrating force of printing in the shaping of market and capital  organization, Febvre and Martin have much to say. For the moment, it is  relevant to bring out here their stress on the early effort of the printers to  attain \"homogeneity de la page\" in spite of poor equilibrium of types, and  \"in spite of defective fonts and in spite of precarious lineality.\" It is precisely  these new effects which were still insecure that would strike the age as having  the utmost charge of meaning and no",

One of the most impressive examples of the  new concern with precision was the action taken by the Church of Rome to  provide a more exact calendar.

But before  turning to its more dramatic manifestations it is necessary to indicate, as  Ong has done, that the obsession with \"method\" in the Renaissance finds its  archetype in \"the process of setting up type taken from a font.

Erasmus directed the new print  technology to the traditional uses of grammatica and rhetoric and to tidying  up the sacred page. Bacon used the new technology for an attempt to tidy  up the text of Nature. In the different spirit of these works one can gauge  the efficacy of print in preparing the mind for applied knowledge.

A strange wedding of the medieval Book of  Nature and the new book from movable  types was conducted by Francis Bacon.  * In order to clarify Bacon's strange ideas about science and the text of  the Book of Nature a brief look at this idea in the Middle Ages is necessary.  Ernst Robert Curtius has taken up the subject of \"The Book as Symbol\"  in chapter xvi of European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages. Greece  and Rome had made little use of book symbol or metaphor, and it \"was  through Christianity that the book received its highest consecration. Christi- anity was a religion or the Holy Book.

Curtius dips here  and there among the poets and theologians and begins his section on the  Book of Nature (pp. 319-20) :  It is a favorite clich\u00e9 of the popular view of history that the Renaissance  shook off the dust of yellowed parchments and began instead to read in the  book of nature or the world.

For the preacher the book of nature must  figure with the Bible as a source of material.  However, it is in Dante himself, according to Curtius (p. 326), that \"the  entire book imagery of Middle Ages is brought together, intensified, broad- ened . . . from the first paragraph of the Vita Nuova to the last canto of  the Divina Commedia.

He writes in Fourteenth Century Verse and Prose (p. xiii) : \"Old English  had a single metre\u2014the long alliterative line without rime.

Aretino had been the first to seize the vernacular as the mass  medium which print had made it.

The editor is considering the  nature of fame and enduring reputation:  ... and to obtain this it is almost necessary, in our age, to be a member of  a national community that has, along with whatever moral and aesthetic  excellences, the quite vulgar quality of being in some degree powerful\u2014  of being regarded attentively by the world and, most important, listened to.

Materialism treated physical bodies and their motions  as the primary reality; idealism took it to be spirit or mind; while Cartesian  dualism postulated two independent realms: the mental res cogitans and the  material res extensa. For the first two schools there was no difficulty in  recognizing unconscious menta",

To the  materialists all mentality was physiological, and the existence of unconscious  physiological processes, similar to and influencing thought, was an immediate  consequence of the fact that our direct awareness of the processes in our  bodies is restricted. And to the idealists all natural processes were the  expression of a universal mind or world spirit of which the human individual  has no direct knowledge, though it shares, in some degree, the characteristics  of human mentality. Thus for the idealists also there was no problem; the  unconscious mind of the individual was not in any way surprising; it ",

Art reversed its role from  guide for perception into convenient amenity or package. But the producer  or artist was compelled, as never before, to study the effect of his art. This in  turn revealed to human attention new dimensions of the function of art. As  manipulators of the mass market tyrannized over the artist, the artist in  isolation achieved new clairvoyance concerning the crucial role o",

Retro- spectively, it may well prove necessary to concede to the period of mass  marketing the creation of the means of a world order in beauty as much as  in commodities.

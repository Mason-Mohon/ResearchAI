Baudrillard had an enduring love of \ufb01lm and was a long-time fan of regularly going to the cinema. Kuttna had been a \ufb01lm critic and Baudrillard cites \ufb01lms",

A propos the cinema and images in general (media images, tech- nological images), I would like to conjure up the perversity of the relation between the image and its referent, the supposed real; the virtual and irreversible confusion of the sphere of images and the sphere of a reality whose nature we are less and less able to grasp. There are many modalities of this absorption, this confu- sion, this diabolical seduction of images. Above all, it is the ref- erence principle of images which must be doubted, this strategy by means of which they always appear to refer to a real world, to real objects, and to reproduce something which is logically and chron",

Seduction plays on the surface thereby challenging theories that \"go beyond\" the manifest to the latent. The model of seduction prefigures Baudrillard's later term, the hyperreal, with all of its post-modernist implications. At the close of the book, Baudrillard tentatively suggests that seduction might be a model to replace the model of production. In Simulacra and Simulations (1981) Baudrillard extends, some would say hyperbolizes, his theory of commodity culture. No longer does the code take priority over or even precede the consumer object.

[Trans.] 28 In G. Perec's description of the \"interior,\" the objects are, through fashion, transcendent, and not objects of a \"series.\" A total cultural constraint, a cultural terrorism, dominates this interior. But this has little effect on the system of consumption itself. 29 The etymology is rather illuminating: \"Everything is consumed\" = \"everything is accomplished\" and of course \"everything is destroyed.\" 28 The System of Objects The Revolution is consumed in the idea of Revolution means that the Revolution is (formally) accomplished and abolished:",

It is never an economy of sex and speech, but an escalation of charm and violence, an instantaneous passion, a moment when sex can occur. But seduction can just as easily exhaust itself in the process of defiance and death, and in the radical indetermination that distinguishes it from an instinct. While indeterminate in relation to its object, instincts are determined as force and as origin. The passion of seduction is without substance and without origin: it is not through some lib",

Baudrillard\u2019s initial book was his doctoral thesis pub- lished in French as Le Syst\u00e8me des Objets in 1968, the year of the May events. In the early 1960s he had published some literary reviews for Les Temps Modernes, the journal founded by Jean-Paul Sartre. There were also many translations which Baud",

There were also many translations which Baudrillard conducted in this period, from German into French, mainly of key \ufb01gures like Karl Marx and Bertolt Brecht. He then studied for a PhD in sociology. Working under the tutelage of Henri Lefebvre, with whom he collaborated on the journal Utopie, Baudrillard subsequently took up a teaching post in sociology at the small University of Nanterre in 1966 where Lefebvre was based and had just publicly broken with the situationists.

In the early 1960s he had published some literary reviews for Les Temps Modernes, the journal founded by Jean-Paul Sartre. There were also many translations which Baudrillard conducted in this period, from German into French, mainly of key \ufb01gures like Karl Marx and Bertolt Brecht. He then studied for a PhD in sociology.

We have based our analysis on everyday objects. But there is another discourse on the object: the discourse of art.

Unlike the early painting of the 20th-century, whose inventive and transcendent spirit did not prevent it becoming a signed object and being commercialised in terms of its signature (Abstract Expressionists carried this triumphant inventiveness and shameful opportunism to new heights), Pop artists recon- cile the object of painting with the painting as object.

By the time of the French publication in the mid 1970s Baudrillard had also published two more books much in\ufb02u- enced by debates around Marxism. Pour Une Critique de l\u2019Economie Politique du Signe came out with Gallimard in 1970 and Le Miroir de la Production was published by Casterman in 1973.

A propos the cinema and images in general (media images, tech- nological images), I would like to conjure up the perversity of the relation between the image and its referent, the supposed real; the virtual and irreversible confusion of the sphere of images and the sphere of a reality whose nature we are less and less able to grasp. There are many modalities of this absorption, this confu- sion, this diabolical seduction of images. Above all, it is the ref- erence principle of images which must be doubted, this strategy by means of which they always appear to refer to a real world, to real objects, and to reproduce something which is logically and chronlogically anterior to themselves. None of this is true. As simulacra, image",

There was a storm of protest at Baudrillard\u2019s supposed nihilism, relativism, postmod- ernism, naivety and amorality which had barely died down by the mid 1990s. For instance, Christopher Norris saw Baudrillard as a postmodernist intellectual whose work, especially on the Gulf War, should be shunned and pilloried as part of a growing body of \u2018uncrit- ical theory\u2019. Many others barely gave it the time of day or merely laughed it out of court. Baudrillard, who had a wicked prankster-like sense of humour, always resented the fact that his work was not taken more seriously.

In some respects Baudrillard\u2019s work during the 1990s started to seem more and more millenarian as references to the threshold year of 2000 increased. The \ufb01rst one which appeared in French, translated into English, is the extract here. Looking back on the end of the century it is hard to overestimate how far this \u2018end-of-the-millennium\u2019 spirit had percolated into media forms, especially popular culture.

In 1994 Polity Press published an English translation by Chris Turner under the overall title The Illusion of the End.

It is a trait of Baudrillard\u2019s work that linear history is to be constantly questioned and The Illusion of the Endis a particularly good example of a book in which he pushes this idea way beyond its limit.

Today we are caught as a species in a similar impasse, trapped between our fossils and our clones. So, the countdown extends in both directions: not only does it put an end to time in the future but it also exhausts itself in the obsessional revival of the events of the past. A reversed recapit- ulation, which is the opposite of a living memory \u2013 it is fanatical memorization, a fascination with commemorations, rehabilita- tions, cultural musei\ufb01cation, the listing of sites of memory, the extolling of heritage.

It has prided itself on this (which was not the case in clas- sical art, where, in a world that was not yet either real or object- ive, the question of usefulness did not even arise). Extending this principle, it is enough to elevate any object to uselessness to turn it into a work of art. This is precisely what the \u2018ready-made\u2019 does, when it simply withdraws an object from its function, without changing it in any way, and thereby turns it into a gallery piece. It is enough to turn the real itself into a useless function to make it an art object, prey to the devouring aesthetic of banality.
